          <h2>What is loafing?</h2>
          <p>
            When a cat is "loafing," they have all four paws tucked underneath
            their body, resembling a loaf of bread. Cats often loaf when they
            are resting, and it is also a method for them to keep warm. There are many different
            types of loafing:
            <ul>
              <li>Sphynx Loaf</li>
              <li>Partial Loaf</li>
              <li>Meatloaf</li>
              <li>Loaf Boat</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <h2>Why do cats love to loaf?</h2>
          <ul class>
            <li>
              Comfort: The loaf position allows cats to stay warm and cozy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Security: When a cat feels like they are in a safe place, they
              will retract their vicious claws and tuck them under their body.
              So, not only are they safe, but so are you!
            </li>
            <li>
              Disguise: Sometimes cats will act as if they are in a relaxed
              loaf, drawing you in with their cuteness. However, this is used as
              an attack tactic, as they won't hesitate to pounce and devour.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Where do cats loaf?</h2>
          <p>
            A very popular positions for cats to loaf is on top of sofas! Many
            cats prefer the top so they can pounce on you after they have
            decided their relaxing loaf time is over.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even though sofas are the
            most popular places, they love to loaf near windows, on chairs, and
            even on the dirt! If the time is right, cats will find a way to cook 
            up a very nice loaf.
